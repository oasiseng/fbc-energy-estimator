# Oasis Energy Estimator

**A web-based preliminary energy load calculator for residential projects in Florida, based on the FBC 2023 R405 Simulated Performance Alternative.**

This tool provides homeowners, builders, and designers with a free, instant, and easy-to-use estimator for preliminary energy calculations. It helps in making informed decisions about insulation, windows, and HVAC systems before finalizing official project plans.

## ⚠️ LEGAL DISCLAIMER & LIMITATION OF LIABILITY ⚠️

**By using the Oasis Energy Estimator (the "Tool"), you acknowledge, agree to, and are bound by the following terms. If you do not agree, do not use this Tool.**

1.  **For Informational & Educational Purposes ONLY.** This Tool is provided strictly for preliminary, informational, and educational purposes. It is NOT a substitute for professional engineering advice, certified energy calculations, or official compliance documentation.

2.  **NO GUARANTEE OF ACCURACY.** The calculations provided are based on simplified, public-domain equations and standardized assumptions. They are not guaranteed to be accurate, complete, or suitable for any specific purpose. Real-world conditions, construction quality, and specific component performance will vary.

3.  **NOT FOR PERMITTING OR CONSTRUCTION.** The output of this Tool **CANNOT** be used for obtaining building permits, demonstrating code compliance to any Authority Having Jurisdiction (AHJ), or for any construction, installation, or financial decision-making purposes. Official compliance requires reports generated by state-approved software (like EnergyGauge) and signed by a certified HERS Rater or Professional Engineer.

4.  **ASSUMPTION OF ALL RISK & LIABILITY.** You, the user, assume **100% of the risk and liability** for any and all use of this Tool and its outputs. You agree that the creator(s) and maintainer(s) of this Tool shall not be held responsible or liable for any errors, omissions, inaccuracies, or for any damages—direct, indirect, incidental, consequential, or otherwise—arising from the use of, or reliance upon, this Tool. This includes, but is not limited to, financial loss, construction defects, failed inspections, or legal disputes.

5.  **NO WARRANTY.** This Tool is provided "AS IS," without any warranty of any kind, express or implied, including but not limited to the warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, and non-infringement.

**In short: You are on your own. Use this data at your own immense risk. We are explicitly released from all liability.**

## Features

* **Instant R405 EPL Score:** Get a preliminary Energy Performance Level (EPL) score to see if your proposed design is on track to pass Florida's energy code.
* **Peak Load Calculations:** Estimates peak heating and cooling loads (Btuh) based on Manual J principles.
* **Annual Energy Breakdown:** Provides a high-level estimate of annual energy use (kWh) for cooling, heating, hot water, and lighting.
* **HVAC Sizing Check:** Verifies if your proposed HVAC capacity is appropriately sized for the calculated load, helping to avoid inefficient, oversized systems.
* **Printable Reports:** Generate a clean, PDF-ready report of the results.
* **Save & Load Projects:** Save your inputs to a JSON file to revisit or share your project later.

## How to Use

1.  **Open the `index.html` file** in any modern web browser.
2.  **Enter Project Data:** Fill in all the fields in the form. The more accurate your inputs, the better the estimate.
3.  **Calculate Results:** Click the "Calculate Results" button.
4.  **Review the Report:** The page will automatically scroll down to a detailed report.
5.  **Save or Print:** Use the "Save Project (JSON)" or "Print Report (PDF)" buttons as needed.

## Code Basis

This tool's calculations are simplified algebraic models based on the principles and baseline requirements found in:

* **Florida Building Code, 8th Edition (2023), Energy Conservation, Section R405 (Simulated Performance Alternative)**
* **ACCA Manual J (8th Edition)** for peak load calculation methodologies.

## For Developers

This is a self-contained, client-side tool. No build process or dependencies are required.

* **Stack:** HTML, Tailwind CSS (via CDN), and vanilla JavaScript.
* **Running:** Simply open the HTML file in a browser.
* **Editing:** All code is contained within the single HTML file for easy modification.
